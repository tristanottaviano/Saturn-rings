*To check if two asteroids are going to collide (between towe points), we are goign to "project" the steroid
*in ttime (projected_x = x + Vx*projected_t), and we are going to check if they end up at the same position,
*at the same time. With some reflexion + internet, we concluded that we needed to solve a polynomial equation (2 degree):
* if there is 0/1 root -> there is no collision, if there are 2, the smallest one is the time at which they collide.
*To solve this equation we are not going to use any num. method as we already know how to (easilly) find the root.
*
*To calculate the resulting velocities of the collision between two asteroids, we are going to use
*the conservation of momentum. This will use a system of 4 equation: we will solve it using the Gauss-Jordan method.
